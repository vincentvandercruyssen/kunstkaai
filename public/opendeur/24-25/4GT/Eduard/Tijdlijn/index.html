    <h3>1989</h3>

    <p>Kurt bought this guitar at a pawnshop for around $30 in late 1989</p>

    <h3>1989</h3>
    <img src="images/2003_CSK_09616_0049_000055457.jpg" alt="">
    <p>This guitar was used by Kurt for a brief period of time in late 1989</p>

    <h2>1975 Fender Mustang</h2>
    <h3>1989</h3>
    <img src="images/unnamed-1024x672.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Kurt was seen playing this guitar only on one occasion, at The Sonic Temple, Wilkinsburg, PA on July 9, 1989. </p>

    <h2>Epiphone ET270</h2>
    <h3>1990</h3>
    <img src="images/Epiphone_ET-270T_Kurt_Cobains_autographed_@_HRC_Pennsylvania-1-768x1024.jpg" alt="">
    <p>This guitar was used in early 1990, the first time probably on January 20th at Legends, Tacoma, WA – at least based on the photos from LiveNirvana.com. It was then used regularly until Kurt smashed it on April 26, 1990, at Pyramid Club in New York. The guitar was also partially featured in the Sub Pop In Bloom music video (2:20-minute mark).</p>

    <h2>Mosrite Gospel Mark IV</h2>
    <h3>1990</h3>
    <img src="images/7673968560_21e555e813_k-1024x683.jpg" alt="">
    <p>This was one of Kurt’s few actual Mosrite guitars, as all of the guitars prior to this were all cheap Univox knock-offs. According to info posted on the auction of the Mosrite decades later, the guitar was purchased by Kurt at Real Guitars in San Francisco in the fall of 1990 (no official page seems to be online, but you can search cached pages for source).</p>

    <h2>Custom Mustang (Blue, In Bloom)</h2>
    <h3>1990</h3>
    <img src="images/2017-01-07-05_42_01-Nirvana-In-Bloom-Alternate-Version-YouTube.jpg" alt="">
    <p>This Mustang was put together by Kurt sometime in early 1990 to serve as a disposable guitar/something he could destroy at the end of a show. It could also be that this is the same guitar that Kurt used in February that year – a pink Mustang that aside from the finish, looked identical to this guitar, but based on an interview that Nirvana did in 1993, they were likely all different guitars.</p>

    <h2>Fender Stratocaster (Black, smashed during “Endless, Nameless”)</h2>
    <h3>1991</h3>
    <img src="images/1991-10-10_007.jpg" alt="">
    <p>In early 1991 Kurt started playing a black left-handed Stratocaster with a white pickguard and a full-sized humbucker in the bridge position. The first time the guitar was photographed appears to be March 5, 1991, at The Bronx in Edmonton, Canada.</p>

    <h2>1960s Univox Hi-Flier Custom</h2>
    <h3>1992</h3>
    <img src="images/Kurt-Cobain-Univox-Hi-Flier-Custom-Moded-vs-Stock.jpg" alt="">
    <p>This guitar was first seen on October 3, 1992, at Carver Gymnasium in Bellingham, Washington. It was given to Kurt by his guitar tech, Ernie Bailey, that same night, backstage just before the gig, and Kurt apparently liked it so much that he decided to use it right away.</p>

    <h2>1969 Fender Competition Mustang</h2>
    <h3>1991</h3>
    <img src="images/Kurt-Cobains-Fender-Mustang-Competition-MoPop-EMP.webp" alt="">
    <p>This guitar is undoubtedly best known for its appearance in the music video for the song Smells Like Teen Spirit, filmed on August 17, 1991. Given that this is the first time chronologically that Kurt ever used it, it is likely that the Mustang was purchased approximately somewhere around that same time.</p>

    <h2>Ferrington Custom</h2>
    <h3>1992</h3>
    <img src="images/exposicao-nirvana.jpg" alt="">
    <p>This guitar was custom built by Danny Ferrington, who allegedly met with the band backstage during the SNL gig in January 1992. He kept in touch with Kurt while the band went on tour in Australia, and he was sent drawings from Kurt via fax on how he imagined this guitar to look like.</p>
